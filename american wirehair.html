<h1>American Wirehair<h1>

<p>The first cat i am researching about is the American Wirehair cat.American Wirehair looks Cobby and rounded, with a robust but not excessive build, the American Wirehair is an attractive, intelligent cat. The coat as the name suggests, is their defining feature, with a hard, wire texture to the dense fur. American Wirehairs have large, round eyes, an open and curious expression, a neat, muscular body and full, rounded paws.The American Wirehair is a playful and active cat, described as having a cute and somewhat humorous personality, happy to sit on laps or play with owners. A rather gentle and quiet cat, they will enjoy some outdoor access, but are very content as indoor cats if given appropriate exercise and entertainment.The American Wirehair originated in upstate New York in 1966 from a naturally-occurring fur mutation that appeared in a kitten from a litter of farm cats. That kitten, (with the impressive name ‘Council Rock Farms Adams of Hi-Fi’ or ‘Adam’ for short) along with another non-wirehaired kitten named Tip-Top were purchased by a breeder of Rex cats, and they founded the breed. Their offspring also had the wire coat, although this varies from kitten to kitten, with some being harsher or curlier than others. American Shorthairs have also been involved in the creation of the American Wirehair and are still a permitted out-cross within the breed. 

They were first recognised by the Cat Fancy Association in 1967 and although popular in America, Canada and Germany, they are still rare in the UK.like all cats , this cat is a carnivores it eats protein like fish and meat and that's all about American Wirehair </p>
